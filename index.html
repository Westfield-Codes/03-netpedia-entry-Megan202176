  <h2>How much screen time?</h2>
  <p>Teenagers today spend an average of <em>4.8 hours per day</em> on various social media platforms, such as Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. While these platforms provide entertainment, connection, and information, they are often created to be addictive. They can also have serious negative side effects, especially for teenagers.</p>

<h2><strong>Effects of Social Media</strong></h2>
<hr>
 <p><em>Anxiety</em> - Too much social media use has been linked to higher rates of depression and anxiety for teenagers. As often only the good parts of peoples lives are shown, constant comparasion with these <em>perfect</em> lives can cause feelings of worry, anxiety, or fear of missing out.</p>
  
  <p><em>Body Image</em> - Social media often has filtered images that can create unrealistic expectations. As filters are often used in images without the audience knowing. Truth on social media sites isn't required, and creators may lie for increased views. These fake images and posts can result in poor body image and low self-esteem.</p>
<p><em>Worsened Sleep</em> - Social media can also affect teenagersâ€™ sleep quality. Many stay up late scrolling through their feeds or watching videos, due to the addictive quality of social media. Which not only reduces the amount of sleep they get but also disrupts their natural sleep cycles due to screen time before bed. Poor sleep can worsen mental health issues, creating a harmful cycle.</p>
<p>While social media can offer some benefits, its overuse can negatively impact teenagers well-being, self-image, and physical health. Finding balance and setting healthy boundaries with technology is essential to protecting mental health. </p>
