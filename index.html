 <h4>Too much social media use has been linked to higher rates of depression and anxiety for teenagers. Social media often has filtered images that can create unrealistic expectations. This can result in poor body image and low self-esteem. </h4>
<h4>Social media can also affect teenagersâ€™ sleep quality. Many stay up late scrolling through their feeds or watching videos, which not only reduces the amount of sleep they get but also disrupts their natural sleep cycles due to screen time before bed. Poor sleep can worsen mental health issues, creating a harmful cycle.</h4>
<h4>While social media can offer some benefits, its overuse can negatively impact teenagers well-being, self-image, and physical health. Finding balance and setting healthy boundaries with technology is essential to protecting mental health. </h4>
